Real-time Sign Language to Text Translation with CNN: This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to seamlessly convert live sign language gestures into text. Integrated with a Python GUI for dynamic input, the system ensures swift and accurate translation, facilitating efficient communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

# Sign Language to Text Translation with CNN

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a real-time sign language to text translation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to provide a seamless and efficient way to convert live sign language gestures into text, enhancing communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network designed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures from live video input.

- **Real-time Translation:** The system operates in real-time, providing instant text translation as users make sign language gestures.

- **Python GUI:** The project includes a user-friendly Python GUI that facilitates live input, making the system accessible and easy to use.
